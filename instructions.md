# ACNH Live Editor — Agent Guidelines

> This is the single source of truth for Copilot and AI agent behavior in this repo.
> It is registered as the official instructions file via `.vscode/settings.json`.

## Architecture

- `server.js` — Express entrypoint and API route composition
- `modules/bridgeService.js` — bridge socket server and request lifecycle
- `modules/nookipediaCatalog.js` — Nookipedia catalog sync, caching, and diagnostics
- `modules/catalogApi.js`, `modules/itemCatalog.js` — catalog access layer
- `public/app.js` — main client behavior and UI state machine
- `public/` — static client assets served directly (no build step)
- `data/` — local item data and cached remote catalog data
- `scripts/steamdeck-adapters/` — Python memory reader chain for Steam Deck bridge

## Design Philosophy

This is a **mobile-first responsive PWA** targeting phone, tablet, desktop, and Steam Deck.

- Mobile-first UI and UX is non-negotiable for all interface decisions.
- Layout, typography, spacing, and touch targets must be validated at mobile widths first.
- Component sizing and responsive breakpoints should degrade gracefully from large to small screens, never the reverse.

## Tech Stack

- Node.js 18+ / Express backend
- Vanilla HTML, CSS, JavaScript frontend (no framework, no build step)
- Local JSON data files; optional live Nookipedia API integration
- Python (`scripts/steamdeck-adapters/`) for Steam Deck memory bridge

## Build and Dev

```powershell
# Stop existing server and start fresh (Windows/PowerShell)
$ports = 3000, 32840
foreach ($port in $ports) {
  $pids = Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort $port -State Listen -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Select-Object -ExpandProperty OwningProcess -Unique
  if ($pids) { $pids | ForEach-Object { Stop-Process -Id $_ -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue } }
}
cd C:\Users\mccoo\OneDrive\Developer\acnh-live-editor
npm run dev
```

- App runs on `http://localhost:3000` by default
- Windows UI target: `http://10.0.0.25:3000`

## Conventions

- No frontend build pipeline — edits to `public/` take effect immediately on reload.
- Bridge reads/writes use the live memory chain only (no file fallback or fake data in MVP mode).
  - Chain: `steamdeck-run-bridge.sh` → `steamdeck-bridge-client.js` → `bridge_memory_tool.py` → `acnh_memory_reader.py`
- Bridge port: `32840`. App port: `3000`.
- Catalog state is `Offline` until `NOOKIPEDIA_API_KEY` is set in `.env`.
- All new bridge/MVP work goes to `dev` first; promote to `master` only after confirmed working.
- Both Windows and Steam Deck repos must be on the same branch and same commit hash during a test cycle.

## Branch Policy

- `dev` — active development and bridge testing
- `master` — stable, confirmed bridge behavior only
- Fast-forward merges only (`--ff-only`); no merge commits.

# Repository Agent Rules

These rules are mandatory for any agent working in this repository.

## Contract Precedence

Apply this order exactly:

1. User request
2. AGENTS guardrails
3. README MVP sections
4. Implementation details

## Mandatory Response Gate

Before any technical answer, include or explicitly check:

1. Scope status
2. README MVP section touched
3. Excluded items and why

This response gate is required in every technical answer.

## README Binding

- Every technical response must cite the exact README heading being followed.
- Drift-check each technical response against:
	1. `MVP Outline Status`
	2. `Shortest Path To Live UI Readback`
- Reject additions that do not advance those sections or the active user request.
- Reject technical answers that do not cite README headings.

## README Edit Permission

- README edits are not auto-approved.
- Do not edit `README.md` unless the user explicitly requests a README change in the active conversation.
- If a README change is needed for MVP safety/run accuracy and was not explicitly requested, stop and ask one concise approval question before editing.

## Scope

- Active scope: bridge reliability, correct IP usage, Steam Deck connectivity, Ryujinx live-memory reads/writes, and data flow to the existing Windows UI.
- Do not expand scope into redesigns, refactors, cleanup, music, catalog, or unrelated MVP ideas unless explicitly requested.
- Primary validation target is the Windows UI at `http://10.0.0.25:3000`; do not switch to isolated endpoints unless explicitly requested for backend-only verification.

## Confirmed Repo Facts

- Windows UI address: `http://10.0.0.25:3000`
- Windows Wi-Fi IP: `10.0.0.25` (confirmed live, `netstat` shows `0.0.0.0:3000` and `0.0.0.0:32840` LISTENING under PID 93128)
- Steam Deck IP: `10.0.0.233`
- Steam Deck SSH key: `C:/Users/mccoo/.ssh/id_ed25519_steamdeck`
- Steam Deck SSH user: `deck`
- Steam Deck bridge target host: `10.0.0.25` (set in `.steamdeck-bridge.env` as `BRIDGE_TARGET_HOST=10.0.0.25`)
- Steam Deck bridge target port: `32840`
- Bridge confirmed CONNECTED: `10.0.0.233` → `10.0.0.25:32840` (verified May 4 2026)
- `.steamdeck-bridge.env` is gitignored — must be set directly on Steam Deck; do not commit it
- Node on Steam Deck: `/home/deck/.nvm/versions/node/v24.14.1/bin/node`
- Bridge systemd service: `~/.config/systemd/user/acnh-live-bridge.service` (auto-starts on boot, restarts on failure)

## Verification Discipline

- Do not make unverified assumptions about user goals, UX changes, environment state, emulator state, or acceptable tradeoffs.
- Do not replace or simplify the UI shell unless explicitly requested.
- When a fact is not confirmed by user, repo, or direct tool output, call it unconfirmed.
- When a missing fact materially affects edits, ask one concise question instead of guessing.
- Do not use conditional phrasing for facts already established in context; state established facts directly.
- Use the Windows UI browser window as the primary validation surface when it is available, inspect rendered outputs there directly, and only send live tests to the running game or project when the user has explicitly authorized the test and the intended live effect has been stated in the work log or response.

## Git Push / Pull Gate

- **Do NOT prompt the user to `git push`, `git pull`, `git pull --ff-only`, sync any machine, or update a remote (Steam Deck, server, etc.) from git UNLESS the user has explicitly confirmed in the active conversation that the code is ready to push/pull.**
- This applies to all machines: local Windows, Steam Deck, any remote.
- If a push or pull step is genuinely required to complete the task, stop and ask one concise approval question before including it in instructions.
- Never bundle a push or pull step silently inside a multi-step command block.

## Work Integrity

- Preserve existing UI unless explicitly told otherwise.
- Prefer the smallest targeted bridge fix over broader cleanup.
- Verify facts with repo reads or command output before changing behavior.
- Keep changes tightly scoped to the exact request.
- No opportunistic edits: if it was not requested, do not modify it.
- Do not change files, paths, response formats, or tooling outside the exact requested change.
- Do not add or modify agent rules unless explicitly requested.
- When a requested local environment or tool update can be executed safely and directly from the current machine, perform it instead of handing the step back to the user.
- Before telling the user to update Steam Deck or another machine from git, ensure the required local code changes are actually committed and pushed. If the user works through GitHub Desktop, explicitly note that GitHub Desktop must show the commit/push completed before the remote machine pulls.

## Command Response Schema

- Always provide explicit step-by-step run instructions.
- If using acronyms, always describe it in perenthesis
- One step title + one fenced code block per step.
- Commands must be plain copy-paste runnable.
- First line must be `cd` when directory context matters.
- No inline commentary inside code blocks.
- Always provide full command text with no placeholders omitted.

## Prompt Follow-Up Questions

- When concluding a prompt, end with exactly three numbered follow-up questions using `1.`, `2.`, `3.` formatting.
- These questions must help the user reply quickly with the next troubleshooting or implementation direction.
- Keep the questions concise and action-oriented so the user can answer by number when iterating on prompts.

## Bug/Issue Confirmation Gate

- **Do NOT prompt the user to proceed to the next task until the bug or issue from the prior request is confirmed resolved.**
- Confirm resolution by directly running the test yourself (via terminal, browser tool, or API call) and verifying correct output before declaring it fixed.
- If the prior bug cannot be self-tested (requires live hardware not accessible from this machine), explicitly state that and ask the user to confirm before moving on.
- Never assume a fix worked just because code was committed. Execute the test. Observe the result. Report the result.
- If a test fails: fix it, re-test, and only then proceed.

## Fail-Closed Live Data Policy

- No synthetic, temporary, substitute, or fake data in UI/debug/runtime responses.
- If real data is unavailable, return unavailable/error; never substitute.
- Automated backend verification data must run only on isolated non-primary ports.
- Automated backend verification data must never appear in UI or debug panels.
- Automated backend verification data is development-only and never live bridge truth.
- Reject any output that uses synthetic/temp/test data as UI/debug truth.

## Automatic Request Contract (Complex Requests)

For complex requests, apply this contract automatically without requiring user attachment:

1. Objective (one exact outcome)
2. Scope (in-scope + explicit exclusions)
3. README binding (`MVP Outline Status`, `Shortest Path To Live UI Readback`)
4. Data policy (fail-closed, no substitution)
5. Change constraints (allowed/forbidden files)
6. Acceptance checks (explicit checks + expected outcomes)
7. Stop condition (ask one concise question when a missing fact materially affects edits)

## Governance Commit Template

For governance/rule changes, use this commit structure:

- Subject: `Consolidate agent governance into AGENTS contract`
- Body bullets:
	- single enforcement source in `AGENTS.md`
	- precedence, response gate, README binding, fail-closed policy
	- removed duplicate policy surfaces
	- README runbook/schema alignment

## Compliance Gate

- If an answer would violate scope, formatting, data policy, or README binding, stop and ask one concise clarification question instead of proceeding.
